      <title>My First Use of Hugo</title>

      <description>I make myself laugh. The title is so &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo;. My first use of hugo is in hugo. :-/ I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for a static website generator not a CMS. For the uninitiated, or you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read the links, a CMS creates the pages a viewer see dynamically when the page is requested (sometime cached), based on looking up data and using templates of sorts to generate pages. A Static Site Generator uses data and templates but pages are generated once during &amp;ldquo;build time&amp;rdquo; and the same stuff is displayed until data/files are changed and another &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; happens.</description>

      <title>Modding a NuVision TM800W560L Tablet</title>

      <description>So a friend gave me a NuVision tm800w560l tablet running Windows 10. Honestly I tried to use it, but it was a joke. From the start with it not connecting to WiFi because Windows 10 wanted uppercase alpha characters even though every other Linux, Android, Mac OS X or iOS device works with lower case. To the fact that the on screen keyboard would hide where I was typing. To the periodic hick-ups.</description>

      <title>An IBM T42 with Manjaro</title>
      <link>http://riotsu.com/blog/2017/09/13/ibm-t42-with-manjaro/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken quite a liking to Manjaro. All the random tasks I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for have turned out extremely well. Enough so that I want to go beyond those very directed needs and do a general review. And I&amp;rsquo;ll start out by installing Manjaro on my IBM/Lenovo T42.
Which is a little late since they just announced deprecating 32-bit / i686 support. So, since I did all this work over a few months, I figure I might as well put out this post.</description>

      <title>Manjaro, a distro that I&#39;m really digging</title>

      <description>Linux &amp;ldquo;distros&amp;rdquo; are many. Linux is awesome that way: scratch an itch, climb that mountain, being as satisfied as a cat. I encourage folks to explore. Head over to Distro Watch to start exploring.
But what makes one stick to a distro? Its a very personal thing. This is the Internet, so I&amp;rsquo;m shouting out what&amp;rsquo;s important to me. :-) A bit of history first. I started in 1997 with Red Hat, moved to Gentoo to learn nuts and bolts, then ended up using Kubuntu because I liked things &amp;ldquo;that just worked&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m late to the game on the Remix Mini PC; which is basically a phone that a monitor, keyboard and mouse get plugged into. [edit] I&amp;rsquo;ve also updated this blog post. One reason is I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it exclusively in the living room. Also, Jide announced they are exiting the consumer market. [/edit] I bought one a bit back because it was on sale and I figured why not.</description>

      <title>Developing on a Chromebook (well, CloudReady), Part 1</title>

      <description>I like the idea of Chrome Apps. It is (was?) a great idea; write one app and it will run on Linux, Chrome OS, Mac and Windows (yeah, the order is telling). It&amp;rsquo;s a shame Google has announced it will stop supporting Chrome Apps on Linux, Mac and Windows. So initially this started out as a log of my adventure of making a Chrome App on Chrome OS (well a Chromium OS distro called CloudReady).</description>

      <description>Hello again, back at my distro hopping. Well, not really, the main machines (desktop and laptop) are still Kubuntu. But if there were a distro to switch to, it might be antergos Linux. At least at first &amp;ldquo;blush&amp;rdquo;. Wow, easy install, easy setup, easy updates. And it feels snappy&amp;hellip;
More details to come. For now, the machine is a Toshiba Satellite A105-S4254: Intel Dual Core T2050 / 1.6 GHz, 3GB RAM, 7200RPM SATA hard drive.</description>

      <description>This is getting to be really late. I forgot to post it, and have since moved on to testing Antergos Linux. Anyways, here is an &amp;ldquo;almost too old to post to post&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using CloudReady on an off on this laptop for a while now. Everything works pretty swimmingly. If you&amp;rsquo;re into the whole Google ecosystem, then using CloudReady should be pretty seamless.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many reviews with agendas, either their own or someone else&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Back to blogging a bit because I&amp;rsquo;m recovering from some surgery. Nothing major. Its only been almost a year and half since my last blogging. :-)
So last time I blogged I used my Toshiba Satellite A105-S4254 laptop to test out Android-x86. A fun experiment, and proved to myself that Android can be used as a desktop if you don&amp;rsquo;t need sophisticated content creation.
Since then I used this laptop to create my own &amp;ldquo;DIY Chromebook&amp;rdquo; using Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>Finishing up my chronicling of using an old laptop that is now running Android-x86. It was running Windows XP. And I hate to throw away useful hardware, but also don&amp;rsquo;t want to use an out-of-date insecure operating system.
Where we last left off was a bit of a hiccup in things. Nothing major, but things were unstable when I had two Google accounts configured at the same time. After I removed the extra account, things have been running smoothly for a while.</description>

      <description>Most of my posts on the topic of running Android-x86 on my old former Windows XP laptop have been positive. And I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;m still positive in general.
Some bad news though is that a bunch of updates for Apps came down and now things are blowing up when I have more then one Google account setup. It took some efforts in trouble shooting and a few reloads in various ways.</description>

      <description>Okay, a busy weekend, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to do much. Sunday was disc (ultimate frisbee-ish), and a bit of work. So no time to do anything on this Android-x86 laptop.
And yesterday, Monday, all I really had time to do was update to Android-x86&amp;rsquo;s first 4.4 release. There isn&amp;rsquo;t any OTA updates, but you can still download the ISO, boot to it, and perform an upgrade just like OTA update.</description>

      <description>So its Saturday. I&amp;rsquo;d thought I&amp;rsquo;d have time to do some additional work related stuff and play on my Android-x86 laptop. But alas, because of errands and usual Saturday shtiff, not much time to play. But I did do some stuff:
 Work had power outage, so was emailing and IM&amp;rsquo;ing on the Android laptop. Also had to look up some stuff to IM my tech support guy who went on site.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been really busy, so haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to keep track of the little I did well. This is basically chronicling my experiment of using Android-x86 on a laptop that used to run Windows XP. Here is a recap of a couple of days combined.
8/5/2014  Checked email, easy to do when brain-dead from a long day. Played Andor&amp;rsquo;s Trail a little bit. Noticed the cut and paste semantics feel a bit odd, but that&amp;rsquo;s because keyboard shortcuts are not available.</description>

      <description>I have an old Toshiba 32-Bit laptop that had Windows XP on it. And since Windows XP is no longer supported, I decided to put Android-x86 on it. I did this a while back, but haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to play with it much. My plan now is to use it as my main laptop and keep a log of what I do or can&amp;rsquo;t do on it for the next bit&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <title>ChromiumOS on my XPS M1530 (and other computers)</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to see how a ChromeOS device works. I want to see how well a ChromeBook would fill the home computing needs. Since I have this nice Dell Latitude XPS M1530, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do some research to see if I could run ChromeOS on it.
There is a person, Hexxeh, who provides nightly builds of the open source ChromiumOS project. These can be downloaded as bootable USB flash drive image, VMWare or VirtualBox disk images.</description>

      <description>I recently had the opportunity to get an Dell XPS M1530 really cheap. So we have the home laptop and now I have a laptop to play around with. Yah!
My intention is to blog what I do with the XPS laptop. As I have time to play with it, I&amp;rsquo;ll add new blog entries. Changing jobs and home life causing changes in focus is okay too. Right now I&amp;rsquo;ve loaded Linux Mint Debian Edition, with the Cinnamon desktop.</description>

      <description>These types of posts often start out with &amp;ldquo;I was talking with a friend&amp;rdquo;. Sooner or later I&amp;rsquo;ll stop saying that. :-) So, a story came up in our conversation about my childhood to illustrate an idea. The story first, and then the idea.
I have one sister and one brother. There were times where we&amp;rsquo;d be getting an after dinner treat. Not to say this didn&amp;rsquo;t happen other times, but I remember it with spumoni (vanilla, chocolate, cherry) ice-cream.</description>

      <description>So for ages I&amp;rsquo;ve used Kyamo to edit MP3 tags. It had been great because it edited multiple tag versions and it also not only viewed embedded album art, but allowed you to edit it. Sadly Kyamo is no longer supported in K/Ubuntu. Well, as with most FOSS, you can always grab the source and compile it yourself.
I had wished I had time to do just that, and maybe update/maintain it.</description>

      <description>Surfing can be fun. I am usually targeted in my use of the Internet, but I&amp;rsquo;m really glad I found this website.
It started out from a potentially annoying thing. Someone whom I have no relation, nor do I have any idea why they wanted to &amp;ldquo;be my friend&amp;rdquo; on Last.fm. That site isn&amp;rsquo;t the website of interest, and I love Last.fm to get recommendations on music. Anyways, I found out it was a band that was being &amp;ldquo;sly&amp;rdquo; as also being a &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Talking with Becca this morning, two relevant thoughts merged into one and came out in the conversation. No need to go into details of that conversation; but that bit of the conversation was something I wanted to get &amp;ldquo;down on paper&amp;rdquo; (at least it feels important to do so at this point in time). It is the subject of this post and was good motivation to try to write posts again.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start posting links to articles I like. Word of mouth and discussing things among friends is what helps make the world more cohesive and ultimately a better place. It also helps lessen fear and increases strength within and without.
So my first is this article: 3 Reasons the “Ground Zero Mosque” Debate Makes No Sense
A highlight is that rhetoric should never replace logic. Our lives are not controlled by fear, and fear spreads.</description>

      <description>Okay, I work remotely in almost everything I do for work. I.e. I remote into the servers and workstations all day every day; very little gets done on my laptop except personal stuff. Whether it be development, database manipulation, webapp/system management, or regular&amp;rsquo;ol&amp;rsquo;tech-support. The projects are mostly for clients, so they stay on clients machines, but I do have my own servers.
Also, most clients use routers (or whatever does the DHCP) out of the box at their office.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sad to say that an individual of great strength, warm and perspective has passed on. I knew Jesse from working with Life Is Good and Project Joy, and really only saw him at those times. But I always remembered him and will always remember him as a great person and for the great impact he had on the world. Life Is Good has a post about Jesse Howes.</description>

      <description>Yeah, cheesy title for an article (original below). But after recently having to help out too many clients and friends with virus issues, I wanted to get this article out there. Its an interesting real-life example of why you should change the password on your router, (and not leave passwords blank in general). Oh, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t speak techie, the router is what usually connects you to the Internet (whether wired or wireless).</description>

      <description>After watching the movie &amp;ldquo;The Watchmen&amp;rdquo;, I had an idea. Its sorta related to the movie &amp;ldquo;Hero&amp;rdquo; as well. And can be said of any story that shows people doing extraordinary things to &amp;ldquo;save the world&amp;rdquo;. No matter the context/size of what &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rdquo; means.
From the start I don&amp;rsquo;t want people to think that I don&amp;rsquo;t like those movies. They inspire me to try to get better to do &amp;ldquo;extraordinary&amp;rdquo; things myself.</description>

      <description>I just read an interesting introduction to &amp;ldquo;Carbon Capture and Storage&amp;rdquo; technology (CCS). Not bad, though I know little. One thing that I think needs a bit more thought is the storage part. They mentioned storage in geological formations deep underground. This speaks of a fundamental part that most people miss. Everything in life is a system. I guess it nice that its underground, far away and &amp;ldquo;not in my backyard&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while. And this one isn&amp;rsquo;t really mine. But, like many, for the first time in a long time, I look to the future with a promising smile. Thanks to Jen, Jim and Ken for their wonderful words.
Barak Obama! Freakylicious President! Get your &amp;ldquo;Mo Jo&amp;rdquo; on! A Haiku from Jen Jag
In bare feet by the thousands, chain-yanked off the auction block, In pinched shoes moving on northward flight, In just bought boots down the new hallways of Tuskegee, In spikes churning up the Berlin dirt under the Fuhrer’s eye, In laced-high shoes stepping through the ring to meet Schmeling In ankle high russet browns trudging through the mud of Anzio and stumbling over the crushed rock of Okinawa, In flashing feet breaking for home plate and all of Brooklyn’s approving roar, In the patent leather shoes of three little girls taking guarded steps to school, In wild gliding, unstoppable, sliding motion on the floor of the Apollo, In steel-toed GPs scrambling for cover at Tet and slogging the water-logged Mekong, In stride, linked and determined, on the march, a preacher’s shined shoes at the fore, from Selma to Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Chicago, and up the steps to dream in Lincoln’s shadow, that long shadow cast across the generations, across the throngs of Washington Mall who have been on the move from every corner of the country and pause now in wonder at where the weary feet have led.</description>

      <title>Do I Like the G1 Android phone by T-Mobile?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve held back on commenting about the G1 from T-Mobile. Mostly for technical reasons and time-wise reasons. But also because I&amp;rsquo;ve been uncertain about how it will turn out and how to talk about it (mostly to non-techie people). Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve had high hopes for it and the Andriod platform. And to say my hopes have been met is not an easy thing.
First, for the non-techies, the G1 is the phone, T-Mobile the carrier and Andriod is the OS (Operating System).</description>

      <title>Collision At The Creation of Ideas</title>

      <description>I was watching either the Daily Show or the Colbert Report the other night. Well, actually both, but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember which one started this idea. During one of them, the guest made an interesting comment (probably in his book).
It was actually two points about &amp;ldquo;the energy crisis&amp;rdquo;. One was a larger comment about bubbles, and that when they burst, they usually leave something significant behind. And the other was related that a bubble of having 100,000 people try out ideas; with 1,000 of them being worth pursuing and 100 of them being brought to a wider audience to try and perhaps 2 having staying power.</description>

      <description>I had the great privilege of being able to travel to Budapest, Hungary twice in 2006. I could go look up the dates, but is it really that important? :-) Below are some pictures from my trips.
A bit of background, historically there were two cities: Buda &amp;amp; Pest. As engineering became better, bridges became better and more permanent. One of the famous ones I think is referred to as &amp;ldquo;The Chain Link Bridge&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>DeGennaro Tomato Sauce</title>
      <link>http://riotsu.com/blog/2000/01/01/degennaro-tomato-sauce/</link>

      <guid>http://riotsu.com/blog/2000/01/01/degennaro-tomato-sauce/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: This is mostly off the top of my head. I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked this as I&amp;rsquo;ve made it and remembered to edit it. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that when I make it I don&amp;rsquo;t really think, I just go. It is based on a family recipe passed down. I.e. mostly traditional, but varied over the generations. So this is the basic idea, I&amp;rsquo;ll do more for &amp;ldquo;insight&amp;rdquo; into a good sauce at some point.</description>
