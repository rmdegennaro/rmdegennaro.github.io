      <description>So for ages I&amp;rsquo;ve used Kyamo to edit MP3 tags. It had been great because it edited multiple tag versions and it also not only viewed embedded album art, but allowed you to edit it. Sadly Kyamo is no longer supported in K/Ubuntu. Well, as with most FOSS, you can always grab the source and compile it yourself.
I had wished I had time to do just that, and maybe update/maintain it.</description>

      <title>DeGennaro Tomato Sauce</title>

      <description>Introduction: This is mostly off the top of my head. I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked this as I&amp;rsquo;ve made it and remembered to edit it. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that when I make it I don&amp;rsquo;t really think, I just go. It is based on a family recipe passed down. I.e. mostly traditional, but varied over the generations. So this is the basic idea, I&amp;rsquo;ll do more for &amp;ldquo;insight&amp;rdquo; into a good sauce at some point.</description>
