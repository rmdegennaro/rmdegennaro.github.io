      <description>So for ages I&amp;rsquo;ve used Kyamo to edit MP3 tags. It had been great because it edited multiple tag versions and it also not only viewed embedded album art, but allowed you to edit it. Sadly Kyamo is no longer supported in K/Ubuntu. Well, as with most FOSS, you can always grab the source and compile it yourself.
I had wished I had time to do just that, and maybe update/maintain it.</description>

      <description>I had the great privilege of being able to travel to Budapest, Hungary twice in 2006. I could go look up the dates, but is it really that important? :-) Below are some pictures from my trips.
A bit of background, historically there were two cities: Buda &amp;amp; Pest. As engineering became better, bridges became better and more permanent. One of the famous ones I think is referred to as &amp;ldquo;The Chain Link Bridge&amp;rdquo;.</description>
