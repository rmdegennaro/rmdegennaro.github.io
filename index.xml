      <title>My First Use of Hugo</title>

      <description>I make myself laugh. The title is so &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo;. My first use of hugo is in hugo. :-/ I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for a static website generator not a CMS. For the uninitiated, or you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read the links, a CMS creates the pages a viewer see dynamically when the page is requested (sometime cached), based on looking up data and using templates of sorts to generate pages. A Static Site Generator uses data and templates but pages are generated once during &amp;ldquo;build time&amp;rdquo; and the same stuff is displayed until data/files are changed and another &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; happens.</description>

      <description>So a friend gave me a NuVision tm800w560l tablet running Windows 10. Honestly I tried to use it, but it was a joke. From the start with it not connecting to WiFi because Windows 10 wanted uppercase alpha characters even though every other Linux, Android, Mac OS X or iOS device works with lower case. To the fact that the on screen keyboard would hide where I was typing. To the periodic hick-ups.</description>

      <title>An IBM T42 with Manjaro</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken quite a liking to Manjaro. All the random tasks I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for have turned out extremely well. Enough so that I want to go beyond those very directed needs and do a general review. And I&amp;rsquo;ll start out by installing Manjaro on my IBM/Lenovo T42.
Which is a little late since they just announced deprecating 32-bit / i686 support. So, since I did all this work over a few months, I figure I might as well put out this post.</description>

      <title>Manjaro, a distro that I&#39;m really digging</title>

      <description>Linux &amp;ldquo;distros&amp;rdquo; are many. Linux is awesome that way: scratch an itch, climb that mountain, being as satisfied as a cat. I encourage folks to explore. Head over to Distro Watch to start exploring.
But what makes one stick to a distro? Its a very personal thing. This is the Internet, so I&amp;rsquo;m shouting out what&amp;rsquo;s important to me. :-) A bit of history first. I started in 1997 with Red Hat, moved to Gentoo to learn nuts and bolts, then ended up using Kubuntu because I liked things &amp;ldquo;that just worked&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>DeGennaro Tomato Sauce</title>
      <link>http://rmdegennaro.github.io/gohugo_site/blog/2000/01/01/degennaro-tomato-sauce/</link>

      <guid>http://rmdegennaro.github.io/gohugo_site/blog/2000/01/01/degennaro-tomato-sauce/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: This is mostly off the top of my head. I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked this as I&amp;rsquo;ve made it and remembered to edit it. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that when I make it I don&amp;rsquo;t really think, I just go. It is based on a family recipe passed down. I.e. mostly traditional, but varied over the generations. So this is the basic idea, I&amp;rsquo;ll do more for &amp;ldquo;insight&amp;rdquo; into a good sauce at some point.</description>

      <description>Introduction: I copied this down from a package. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to tweak it to my pleasure with real spices/ingredients, not what is included in the pre-fab package.

      <description>I love food. I like to eat, I like to cook. I&amp;rsquo;m part Italian and a cancer; what can I say? I also like to make up my own recipes, usually only reading cook books for ideas.
Recipes are very limited right now, as I have recipes, like so much else, scattered in books, files, websites, bookmarks, scraps of paper, etc. With the new Google Sites there is not an automatic way to create a list of sub-pages.</description>

      <description>Music is a big part of my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a few bands through out my history, check that info out below. My tastes are varied and since I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Google Play Music to listen to and sync music across devices, I don&amp;rsquo;t really have something to share for my tastes. You could check out my last.fm page, but it is probably out of date by quite a number of years.</description>

      <description>Technology seems to be ever present these days. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m on the cutting edge of it all, but I do play around with technology. It&amp;rsquo;s my profession; it&amp;rsquo;s a hobby.
I keep a Google Site called Adventures in Technology. It has pages for active projects; well many have dust on them. There are also sections that are &amp;ldquo;reference manual&amp;rdquo; in nature. Basically anything that is not just a &amp;ldquo;one off&amp;rdquo; blog posting goes up there&amp;hellip;.</description>
