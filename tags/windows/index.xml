      <description>Yeah, cheesy title for an article (original below). But after recently having to help out too many clients and friends with virus issues, I wanted to get this article out there. Its an interesting real-life example of why you should change the password on your router, (and not leave passwords blank in general). Oh, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t speak techie, the router is what usually connects you to the Internet (whether wired or wireless).</description>
