      <description>So a friend gave me a NuVision tm800w560l tablet running Windows 10. Honestly I tried to use it, but it was a joke. From the start with it not connecting to WiFi because Windows 10 wanted uppercase alpha characters even though every other Linux, Android, Mac OS X or iOS device works with lower case. To the fact that the on screen keyboard would hide where I was typing. To the periodic hick-ups.</description>

      <title>An IBM T42 with Manjaro</title>
      <link>http://riotsu.com/blog/2017/09/13/ibm-t42-with-manjaro/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken quite a liking to Manjaro. All the random tasks I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for have turned out extremely well. Enough so that I want to go beyond those very directed needs and do a general review. And I&amp;rsquo;ll start out by installing Manjaro on my IBM/Lenovo T42.
Which is a little late since they just announced deprecating 32-bit / i686 support. So, since I did all this work over a few months, I figure I might as well put out this post.</description>

      <title>Manjaro, a distro that I&#39;m really digging</title>

      <description>Linux &amp;ldquo;distros&amp;rdquo; are many. Linux is awesome that way: scratch an itch, climb that mountain, being as satisfied as a cat. I encourage folks to explore. Head over to Distro Watch to start exploring.
But what makes one stick to a distro? Its a very personal thing. This is the Internet, so I&amp;rsquo;m shouting out what&amp;rsquo;s important to me. :-) A bit of history first. I started in 1997 with Red Hat, moved to Gentoo to learn nuts and bolts, then ended up using Kubuntu because I liked things &amp;ldquo;that just worked&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Developing on a Chromebook (well, CloudReady), Part 1</title>

      <description>I like the idea of Chrome Apps. It is (was?) a great idea; write one app and it will run on Linux, Chrome OS, Mac and Windows (yeah, the order is telling). It&amp;rsquo;s a shame Google has announced it will stop supporting Chrome Apps on Linux, Mac and Windows. So initially this started out as a log of my adventure of making a Chrome App on Chrome OS (well a Chromium OS distro called CloudReady).</description>

      <title>ChromiumOS on my XPS M1530 (and other computers)</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to see how a ChromeOS device works. I want to see how well a ChromeBook would fill the home computing needs. Since I have this nice Dell Latitude XPS M1530, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do some research to see if I could run ChromeOS on it.
There is a person, Hexxeh, who provides nightly builds of the open source ChromiumOS project. These can be downloaded as bootable USB flash drive image, VMWare or VirtualBox disk images.</description>

      <title>New system. New blog entry. New distro too?</title>

      <description>I recently had the opportunity to get an Dell XPS M1530 really cheap. So we have the home laptop and now I have a laptop to play around with. Yah!
My intention is to blog what I do with the XPS laptop. As I have time to play with it, I&amp;rsquo;ll add new blog entries. Changing jobs and home life causing changes in focus is okay too. Right now I&amp;rsquo;ve loaded Linux Mint Debian Edition, with the Cinnamon desktop.</description>

      <title>Simple Low-resource Linux for a Virtual Machine</title>
      <link>http://riotsu.com/blog/2010/05/12/simple-low-resource-linux-virtual-machine/</link>

      <description>Okay, I work remotely in almost everything I do for work. I.e. I remote into the servers and workstations all day every day; very little gets done on my laptop except personal stuff. Whether it be development, database manipulation, webapp/system management, or regular&amp;rsquo;ol&amp;rsquo;tech-support. The projects are mostly for clients, so they stay on clients machines, but I do have my own servers.
Also, most clients use routers (or whatever does the DHCP) out of the box at their office.</description>

      <title>Do I Like the G1 Android phone by T-Mobile?</title>
      <link>http://riotsu.com/blog/2008/12/09/andriod-g1-by-t-mobile/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve held back on commenting about the G1 from T-Mobile. Mostly for technical reasons and time-wise reasons. But also because I&amp;rsquo;ve been uncertain about how it will turn out and how to talk about it (mostly to non-techie people). Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve had high hopes for it and the Andriod platform. And to say my hopes have been met is not an easy thing.
First, for the non-techies, the G1 is the phone, T-Mobile the carrier and Andriod is the OS (Operating System).</description>
